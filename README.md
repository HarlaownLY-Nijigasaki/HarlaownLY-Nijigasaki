## Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m Larry 😄
A Software Engineering graduate from Curtin University (Australia) with a strong passion for building iOS and Android applications that genuinely improve quality of life.

I enjoy turning ideas into real, usable products — from concept sketching in Figma to writing clean, functional code. I’m  interested in mobile app development and user-focused design.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
	•	Primary languages: Java, Swift, C
	•	Currently learning: TypeScript, JavaScript
	•	Tools I love:
	  -	Figma (for visualising and structuring ideas)
	  -	Notepad++ (Windows) / CotEditor (macOS)

🌱 A bit about me
	•	🐱 Proud human of two British Shorthair cats
	•	🍵 Big fan of Japanese green tea
	•	🎌 Anime lover (yes, my name gives it away 😄)
	•	🛠️ Hobbies: anime & building things from scratch

I believe good software should feel natural, helpful, and quietly powerful.
